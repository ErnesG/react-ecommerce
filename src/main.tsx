   * React StrictMode Wrapper
   * 
   * StrictMode is a development-only tool that helps identify potential problems
   * in an application. It's one of the most important development tools for
   * maintaining code quality and future React compatibility.
   * 
   * üîç CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF STRICTMODE:
   * 
   * 1. **Double-Execution Detection**:
   *    - Intentionally double-invokes functions like useState, useMemo, useEffect
   *    - Helps identify side effects that should be pure
   *    - Catches bugs that might only appear in production due to React's optimizations
   * 
   * 2. **Deprecated API Detection**:
   *    - Warns about usage of deprecated lifecycle methods
   *    - Identifies unsafe legacy patterns that will break in future React versions
   *    - Helps with gradual migration to modern React patterns
   * 
   * 3. **Memory Leak Prevention**:
   *    - Helps identify missing cleanup in useEffect hooks
   *    - Warns about potential memory leaks from subscriptions, timers, etc.
   *    - Ensures proper component cleanup patterns
   * 
   * 4. **Future React Compatibility**:
   *    - Prepares code for React's concurrent features
   *    - Ensures components work correctly with React's internal optimizations
   *    - Validates that components can handle being unmounted/remounted
   * 
   * 5. **Development Best Practices**:
   *    - Encourages writing resilient, side-effect-free code
   *    - Promotes proper state management patterns
   *    - Helps maintain consistent component behavior
   * 
   * üìù NOTE: StrictMode only runs in development mode and is automatically
   * stripped out in production builds, so there's no performance impact on
   * end users.
   * 
   * üö® NEVER REMOVE StrictMode to "fix" double-execution issues - instead,
   * fix the underlying code to be side-effect free and idempotent.
