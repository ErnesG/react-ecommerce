/**
 * @fileoverview Tailwind CSS Configuration

 * It defines the content scanning paths, extends the default theme with custom colors,
 * and establishes the design system foundation for consistent UI components.
 * 
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @see {@link https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration} Tailwind Configuration Docs

   * Content Configuration - File Scanning Setup
   * 
   * Defines which files Tailwind should scan to generate the final CSS bundle.
   * This is critical for tree-shaking unused styles and optimizing bundle size.
   * 
   * üéØ SCANNING STRATEGY:
   * - Includes HTML entry point for base template classes
   * - Scans all TypeScript/JavaScript files in src directory
   * - Covers React components (.tsx, .jsx) and utility files (.ts, .js)
   * - Uses glob patterns for comprehensive coverage
   * 
   * üì¶ BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION:
   * - Only includes CSS for classes actually used in these files
   * - Significantly reduces production CSS bundle size
   * - Enables Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation

       * Custom Color Palette - Primary Brand Colors
       * 
       * Defines a consistent primary color system following Tailwind's
       * numeric scale convention (50-900). This creates a cohesive design
       * language across all UI components.
       * 
       * üé® COLOR SYSTEM DESIGN:
       * - Based on blue color family for professional e-commerce appearance
       * - Follows Tailwind's semantic naming (50 = lightest, 900 = darkest)
       * - Provides multiple shades for different UI states and contexts
       * 
       * üõ†Ô∏è USAGE EXAMPLES:
       * - bg-primary-50:   Light backgrounds, subtle accents
       * - bg-primary-500:  Primary buttons, main brand elements
       * - bg-primary-600:  Hover states for primary elements
       * - bg-primary-700:  Active states, pressed buttons
       * 
       * üí° DESIGN DECISIONS:
       * - Blue conveys trust and professionalism (ideal for e-commerce)
       * - Limited palette ensures consistency and prevents color chaos
       * - Semantic naming makes it easy for developers to choose appropriate shades
